# **zatsit** blog contents repository

This repository holds the contents of the **zatsit** blog: articles, authors and
their pictures. Nothing else.

The site itself lives in [zats-blog](https://github.com/zatsit-oss/zats-blog),
built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). Its loader reads this repository in
place, next to it, so there is no copy and no synchronisation step.

Feel free to contribute to the blog by creating a pull request.

## Write a new post

Please follow the [posting guidelines](./POSTING.md) to write a new post.

Opening your Pull Request triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the
site and deploys it to an ephemeral Firebase preview channel. Wait a few seconds
and check the preview link commented on the PR.

Merging to `main` publishes to <https://blog.zatsit.fr>, a GCS bucket fed by the
same pipeline.

## Preview locally

Optional, and only useful to check rendering before opening a PR. Clone the site
repository **beside** this one, the directory names matter:

```
your-workspace/
├── zats-blog/          ← the site
└── zats-blog-content/  ← this repository
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zatsit-oss/zats-blog.git
cd zats-blog
npm install
npm run dev
```

> **Training repository:** clone `zats-blog-content-training` under the name
> `zats-blog-content`, otherwise the site renders another checkout, or nothing:
> `git clone git@github.com:zatsit-oss/zats-blog-content-training.git zats-blog-content`

Editing an article here shows up immediately. Search is the exception: its index
is produced by the build, so it needs `npm run build && npm run preview`.
