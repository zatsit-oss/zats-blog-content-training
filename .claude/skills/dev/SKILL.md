description: Start the zats-blog Astro dev server on this content
---

The site is rendered by the sibling shell `../zats-blog`, which reads the content from
`../zats-blog-content` (exact name, hard-coded in its `src/consts.ts` and `src/utils/avatars.ts`).

1. Check that `../zats-blog` exists, and that `../zats-blog-content` is this repository (a symlink to it or the
   checkout itself). If it is another checkout, tell the user: the build would render stale content.
2. Start the server:

```bash
cd ../zats-blog && npm run dev
```

The site is on http://localhost:4321 and reloads when an article changes. Search does not work in dev
(Pagefind index is built by `/build`).
