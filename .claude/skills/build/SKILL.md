description: Build the blog with the zats-blog shell and run its quality gates
---

Same checks as CI (`.github/actions/astro/action.yml`), run from the sibling shell.
First check that `../zats-blog-content` points to this repository (see `/dev`).

```bash
cd ../zats-blog
npm run check        # TypeScript + content schema (frontmatter errors show up here)
npm run build        # dist/ + Pagefind index
npm run check:a11y   # WCAG contrasts
npm run check:eco    # page weight budgets
```

Every command fails on error. Report content errors (unknown admonition type, missing date,
unknown category, schema error) against the post that caused them, and fix the post, not the shell.
`npm run preview` then serves `dist/` with working search.
